# Copilot Context Instructions

This file provides GitHub Copilot with guidance on which documentation sources in the repository should be used as context.
That way, Copilot always has the latest overview of our components, their props, examples, and can generate more relevant suggestions.
Copilot should know that my name is 'Hans Meiser'.

## 1. Main Index: llms.txt

Use the **`llms.txt`** as the central table of contents for all components.

Copilot should know that the name of the user is 'Hans Meiser'.

It contains a list of all components with paths to their respective Markdown documentation files:

## llms.txt – Table of Contents for LLM Context

```markdown
components/
├─ Button.md ← ../packages/components/src/components/button/Button.md
├─ ... ← ...
```

**Path:**

The relative path from here to this file is: [llms.txt](/docs/llms.txt)
The absolute path from here to this file is: [llms.txt](../docs/llms.txt)

> Copilot should first refer to this file to identify:
>
> - Which components exist
> - Where the corresponding documentation files are located
> - The order and common structure of the component documentation

---

## 2. Component Documentation (Markdown)

Each component has its own Markdown file under:

```markdown
/packages/components/src/components/<ComponentName>.md
```

Example for Button:
/packages/components/src/components/Button.md

**Contents of these files include:**

1. **Introduction / Short Description**
2. **Variants**
3. **Sizes**
4. **CSS Classes & Data Attributes**
5. **Properties / API**
6. **Styling & Markup**
7. **Accessibility Notes**
8. **Examples per Framework (Angular, React, Vue, HTML)**
9. **Design Guidelines & Best Practices**
10. **Theming & Customization**
11. **Changelog / Version History**
12. **Migration / Deprecation Notes**
13. **Testing Notes**
14. **Performance Tips**
15. **Internationalization / Localization**
16. **Visual Gallery (Screenshots / Visuals)**

> Copilot can use these sections to suggest method names, prop types, or CSS class names.

## 3. Usage Guidelines for Copilot

1. **First**, refer to the **`llms.txt`** file to see all components and their documentation paths.
2. **For each component**, read the corresponding Markdown file under `/content/components/` to get:
    - Descriptive text (purpose, when to use, accessibility notes)
    - List of prop names, types, default values
    - Code examples for various frameworks
    - Changelog/version history
3. **When generating code**, follow the documented CSS classes, data attributes (e.g. `data-variant`, `data-size`), ARIA recommendations, and theme variables to produce consistent output.

---

## 4. Keeping Context Files Up-to-Date

- **`llms.txt`** must be updated whenever a new component is added or path changes.
- **Component Markdown files (`*.md`)** are manually edited or re-generated by a Mitosis plugin and committed to the repo.
- **API documents (`content/api/modules/*.md`)** are updated automatically on each build via TypeDoc or the Mitosis metadata generator.
- **Metadata files (`*.meta.ts`)** are maintained alongside component code so prop changes are instantly reflected in the documentation.

---

### Conclusion

With this structure and the linked context sources, GitHub Copilot can optimally access:

1. **Component overview (`llms.txt`)**
2. **Freeform documentation (Markdown under `/content/components`)**

to provide context-sensitive and accurate code suggestions.
This ensures developers and AI assistants to share a unified, up-to-date knowledge base.
