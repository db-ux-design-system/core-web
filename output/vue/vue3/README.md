...
```

## Custom Events

We do not provide every event on every component. If you are missing an event please [add an issue](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/issues).

As a workaround you can use refs:

### Ref on component

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DBButton } from "@db-ui/v-components";

import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
const buttonRef: any = ref(null);

onMounted(() => {
	buttonRef.value.$refs.component.addEventListener("mouseenter", (ev) => {
		console.log(ev);
	});
});
</script>

<template>
	<DBButton ref="buttonRef">Test</DBButton>
</template>
```

### Ref on nested component

```tsx
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DBInput } from "@db-ui/v-components";

import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
const inputRef: any = ref(null);

onMounted(() => {
	inputRef.value.$refs.formRef.addEventListener("mouseenter", (ev) => {
		console.log(ev);
	});
});
</script>

<template>
	<DBInput ref="inputRef">Test</DBInput>
</template>
```
