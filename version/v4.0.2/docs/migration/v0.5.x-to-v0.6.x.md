# Migration Beta (0.5.x) ➡ Beta (0.6.x)

## Icons

We removed the `.svg` icons from `@db-ux/core-foundations`. This will not affect the `woff2` files required for components. If you still need some `.svg` files you need to install [`@db-ux/core-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/core-icons).

## Components

We changed some properties for components to align with Figma properties:

### Accordion-Item

- `content` ➡️ `text`

### Notification

- `behaviour="closeable|permanent"` ➡️ `closeable="true/false"`- Defaults to `false`

### Form-Components (Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Textarea)

- `variant="hidden"` ➡️ `showLabel="true/false"` - Defaults to `true`
- `customValidity` ➡️ `validation`

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code (except for `content` to `text` attribute on `Accordion-Item`). Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/core-migration --type=v005_v006 --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our icon names for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to icons.
