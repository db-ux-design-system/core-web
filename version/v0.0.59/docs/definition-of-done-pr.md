# Definition of done for Pull Requests

## General

-   Depending on necessary code changes for consuming packages you'll probably need to add entries to [`docs/migrationGuide.adoc`](docs/migrationGuide.adoc)
-   Please have a final lookup of all of your changes e.g. within the "Files changed" tab of the PR within GitHub. This final check could lead to some findings on outstanding work, missing TODOs, `console.log` leftovers or whatever.

## Added patterns

-   Update the test-URLs within `.pa11yci` and `tests/backstop.json`
