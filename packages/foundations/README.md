A library containing all tokens of [DB UX Design System (technical components)](https://github.com/db-ui/mono).

We currently support:

-   [CSS](#css)
-   [SCSS](#scss)
-   [Tailwind](#tailwind)

## Install

`npm i @db-ui/foundations`

## Usage

The defaults for `db-ui-foundations.css` are:

-   [Tonality](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/db-ux-design-system-v3/principles/tonalities): `regular`
-   [Adaptive Coloring](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/db-ux-design-system-v3/principles/adaptive-styles): `neutral-0`

### CSS

Default assets path for `db-ui-foundations.css` is `../assets`. Make sure to copy all used resources like icons and fonts into your `public` folder before build.

```ts
// main.ts / main.js
import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/db-ui-foundations.css";
// optional: to use classes like e.g. db-ui-bg-success
import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/colors/classes/all.css";
```

```css
.my-container {
	padding: var(--db-spacing-fixed-md);
}
```

```html
<div class="db-ui-regular db-ui-bg-success my-container"></div>
```

### SCSS

Based on your technology/setup you need to change the paths of the assets folder:

-   Default: points to `../assets`
-   Webpack: points to `~@db-ui/foundations/assets`
-   Rollup: points to `@db-ui/foundations/assets`

```scss
// index.scss
@use "@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/rollup.assets-paths" as *;
@use "@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/icon/icons" as *;
@use "@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/db-ui-foundations" as *;
// optional: to use db-ui-bg-success
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/color-classes" as *;
// optional: to use use $db-spacing-fixed-md
@use "@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/variables.global" as *;

.my-container {
	padding: $db-spacing-fixed-md;
}
```

```html
<div class="db-ui-regular db-ui-bg-success my-container"></div>
```

### Tailwind

```javascript
//tailwind.config.cjs

const tokens = require("@db-ui/foundations/build/tailwind/tailwind-tokens.json");

module.exports = {
	content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
	plugins: [],
	theme: {
		screens: tokens.screens,
		spacing: tokens.spacing,
		boxShadow: tokens.elevation,
		gap: ({ theme }) => ({
			...theme("spacing")
		}),
		space: ({ theme }) => ({
			...theme("spacing")
		})
	}
};
```

```html
<div class="p-fix-md"></div>
```

## Icons

We use icon fonts as `woff2` files for all our icons.
We auto generate these files out of `.svg` files.

### Custom Icons

If you have custom icons and want to use them for foundations and/or in components, you need to generate a `woff2` file.

For this run:

```shell
node node_modules/@db-ui/foundations/scripts/generate-icon-fonts/index.js --src ./my-path-to/icons --fontName my-name
```

We search for all `**/*.svg` files inside the `src` directory and create a new icon font with the provided name.

> **_NOTE:_** We use 3 different sizes for components (16,20,24) to show more or less details. You can do the same by providing another file with a size postfix for example "icon_file_name_16.svg".

In your app you need to include some of the generated files:

`./my-path-to/icons/fonts/my-name.woff2`

`./my-path-to/icons/fonts/font-face.css`

Now you can use your icons with your `font-family: my-name`, e.g.:

```html
<!--example.html-->
<i class="my-name">icon_file_name</i>
```

### data-icon

If you like to use a custom icon in one of our components you can do it by overwriting the default font-family like this:

```html
<!--example.html-->

<p class="icon-family-my-name" data-icon="icon_file_name">Test</p>
<!-- or -->
<p data-icon-family="my-name" data-icon="icon_file_name">Test</p>
```

### Foundation Developer

If you update a `svg` inside `assets/icons/functional/images` you need to recreate the `woff2` file.

For this you just need to run

```shell
npm run generate:icon-fonts
```

Your new icon should be inside `assets/icons/functional/fonts/info.json` and you should see it inside `assets/icons/functional/fonts/index.html` in the browser.
