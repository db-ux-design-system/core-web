## Usage

We provide a CLI tool to copy `@db-ux` docs to your repository to provide it for AI Agents.

### Prerequisites

Before using this CLI tool, make sure you have the appropriate DB UX Design System packages installed in your project. Currently we've released the documentation for GitHub copilot with pre-releases with the `next` npmjs tag, that include "-copilot*-*", like e.g. "3.0.2-copilot3-1616965".

#### Installing DB UX Packages

For pre-release versions:

```shell
npm install @db-ux/core-components@next @db-ux/core-foundations@next
```

### Running the CLI Tool

Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/agent-cli
```

The DB UX Design System docs will get appended (or replaced in subsequent runs, e.g. after a DB UX Design System update) within the file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (if the file doesn't exist in your codebase so far, it gets created).

### Advanced Usage

You can also change the root path where the tool should check for `node_modules`:

```shell
npx @db-ux/agent-cli packages/frontend
```

This is useful in monorepo setups where your DB UX packages are installed in a specific workspace directory.

### What the tool Does

1. **Scans your project** for installed `@db-ux` packages
2. **Extracts relevant documentation** based on your installed versions
3. **Creates or updates** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with component documentation
4. **Provides AI agents** with context about available components and their usage patterns
