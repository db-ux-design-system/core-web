## Usage

We provide a command-line interface (CLI) tool that copies the `@db-ux` documentation to your repository, making it available to AI agents.

### Running the CLI Tool

Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/agent-cli
```

The DB UX Design System documentation will be added to (or replaced in subsequent runs, e.g. after a DB UX Design System update) in the file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (if this file does not yet exist in your codebase, it will be created).

### Advanced Usage

You can also change the root path where the tool should check for `node_modules`:

```shell
npx @db-ux/agent-cli packages/frontend
```

This is useful in monorepo setups where your DB UX packages might be installed in a specific workspace directory.

### What the tool does

1. **Scans your project's node_modules** for installed `@db-ux` packages
2. **Extracts relevant documentation** based on your installed versions
3. **Creates or updates** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with component documentation
4. **Provides AI agents** with context about available components and their usage patterns

### Best practices

We've had the best experience with GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q when using the following settings:

- Agent mode works best for code generation and may also offer the best developer experience.
- Regarding the provided models, GPT-4o seemed to strike the best balance between "used tokens" and performance, although "Claude Sonnet 4" is still better. However, you run out of tokens quite quickly with this model.
- If you're primarily interested in testing this functionality at the moment, we have quite a bit of experience using a prompt that is both equal and non-trivial, but rather complex, such as "Can you create a new page with a dashboard? It should contain selections for KPIs. Each KPI is a card containing information and buttons."
