- [Angular components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/ngx-core-components)
- [React components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/react-core-components)
- [Vue components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/v-core-components)
- [Web components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/wc-core-components)

Please take a look at your desired framework to retrieve more information.

For additional information besides the frameworks see our [Getting started](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/core-web/tree/main/packages/components/docs/getting-started.md).

---

If you just need the styling follow this:

## Install

`npm i @db-ux/core-components`

## Styling Dependencies

Import the styles in `scss` or `css`. Based on your technology the file names could be different.

- `relative`: asset path point to `../assets`
- `webpack`: asset path point to `~@db-ux/core-foundations/assets`
- `rollup`: asset path point to `@db-ux/core-foundations/assets`

They are bundling all dependencies from [foundations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/core-foundations) and all [components](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/core-web/blob/main/packages/components/src/styles/db-ux-components.scss) available.

**SCSS**

```scss
// index.css
@forward "@db-ux/core-components/build/styles/rollup";
```

**CSS**

Within HTML files directly:

```html
<!-- index.html //-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/rollup.css" />
```

Or within your JavaScript files, with the related bundler as a prefix (in this case rollup and equivalents like Vite):

```js
// main.js
import "@db-ux/core-components/build/styles/rollup.css";
```

### DB Theme

In case that you're building a website or application for Deutsche Bahn, you'll additionally have to install the DB Theme via the [`@db-ux/db-theme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/db-theme) node package (even also available as an inner source node package, as described within that packages README).

### Optimize dependencies

If you only need some of the components or some features from [`@db-ux/core-foundations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/core-foundations), you shouldn't include the bundled file.
In the case you want to include only some components, and you could do it like this:

```css
/* The theme contains all prop required for components like spacings, colors, ... */
@import "@db-ux/core-foundations/build/styles/default-theme.css";
/* The font include uses default font families based on your bundling paths (relative, absolute, webpack, rollup) */
@import "@db-ux/core-foundations/build/styles/fonts/include-rollup.css";
/* The required styles will normalize css and add focus and default font to body */
@import "@db-ux/core-foundations/build/styles/init/required.css";
/* The default root adds a default color space (neutral) and a density (regular) */
@import "@db-ux/core-foundations/build/styles/init/default-root.css";

/* Optional: Add animations / transitions for components */
@import "@db-ux/core-components/build/styles/component-animations.css";

/* Optional: Add data-icon/data-icon-after to global attributes to enable icons for components */
@import "@db-ux/core-foundations/build/styles/icons/include-rollup.css";

/* Optional: Add components */
@import "@db-ux/core-components/build/components/button/button.css";
@import "@db-ux/core-components/build/components/input/input.css";
```
