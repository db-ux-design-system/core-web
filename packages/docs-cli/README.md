## Usage

We provide a cli tool to copy `@db-ux` docs to your repository to provide it for AI Agents.
Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/docs-cli
```

This will search for all `@db-ux` packages inside your `node_modules` and copy the documentation to your repository.
A new folder will be created named `__db-ux-docs__`.

You might want to add this folder to your `.gitignore` file.

You can also change the root path where the tool should check for `node_modules`:

```shell
npx @db-ux/docs-cli packages/frontend
```
