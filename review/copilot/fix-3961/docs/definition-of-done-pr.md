# Definition of done for Pull Requests

## General

- Depending on the necessary code changes for consuming packages, you may need to add a new file or include entries for the next release in the [`/docs/migration`](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/core-web/tree/main/docs/migration) folder.
- Please perform a final lookup of all of your changes, for example by checking the "Files changed" tab of your pull request on GitHub. This final review might lead to some findings on outstanding work, missing TODOs, `console.log` leftovers or other issues.
