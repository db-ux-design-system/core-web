# How to do a dev research

## Introduction

For most of our newly developed components we'd like to do a dev research, exploring other Design Systems solutions and how they solved the same problem. This is a great way to learn from others and to make sure we're not reinventing the wheel. Furthermore we can talk to the community and get feedback on our ideas.
