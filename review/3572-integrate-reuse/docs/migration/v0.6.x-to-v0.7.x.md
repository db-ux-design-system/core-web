## Migration Beta (0.6.x) âž¡ Beta (0.7.x)

### Removed brand assets

We needed to remove the brand assets (font & icons) from our [`@db-ui/foundations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/foundations) node package. Please follow the guidelines within [DB Marketingportal](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/db-ux-design-system/resources/db-theme) on how to retrieve it either as an Inner Source package (DB internal) or to still install the node package from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/db-theme) (DB external).

### Path changes

We needed to change some path, so you would probably need to make some adaptions within your code:
- Changed `@db-ui/foundations/build/scss/` to `@db-ui/foundations/build/styles/`
- Changed `@db-ui/foundations/build/css/` to `@db-ui/foundations/build/styles/`
- Changed `@db-ux/core-icons/` to `@db-ux/core-icons/build`

And icon font files have been moved from `functional/fonts/` one level up to `fonts/` folder, probably you would need to copy those to your codebase as well again if you don't use a bundler.

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

\```shell

npx @db-ui/migration --type=v006_v007 --src=./src
\```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace regarding the path.
