## Migration Beta (0.7.x) ➡ Beta (x.x.x)

### Components

We changed some properties for components to align with Figma properties:

#### Accordion

- `behaviour="default"` ➡️ `behaviour="divider"`

#### Card

- `behaviour="default"` ➡️ `behaviour="static"`

#### Tooltip

- `variant="'with arrow'|'basic'"` ➡️ `showArrow="true|false"` - Defaults to `true`

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ui/migration --type=v007_vXXX --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterward, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our icon names for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to icons.
