# Issue Triage Steering

Automated issue triage for the `db-ux-design-system/core-web` repository using GitHub MCP tools. Validates issue quality, assigns labels, sets priority/effort, and posts an AI-generated summary comment.

## Repository Context

- **Owner**: `db-ux-design-system`
- **Repo**: `core-web`
- **CODEOWNERS** (team members): `mfranzke`, `nmerget`, `michaelmkraus`, `bruno-sch`

## Issue Templates

The repository has these issue templates:

1. **🐞 Bug Report** (`bug_report.yaml`) — Required fields: reproduction case, expected behaviour. Optional: affected generators, browser, screenshots, business unit, project.
2. **📄 GitHub Copilot Instructions feedback** (`github_copilot_instructions.yaml`) — Required fields: what didn't work as expected. Optional: model used, prompt, suggestions, IDE, clarity rating.

## Single Issue Triage Workflow

When the user provides an issue number, perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Fetch Issue Details

1. Use `mcp_github_issue_read` (method: `get`) to get the full issue including author, title, body, labels, and type.
2. Use `mcp_github_issue_read` (method: `get_labels`) to see currently assigned labels.
3. Use `mcp_github_issue_read` (method: `get_comments`) to read all comments (and/or timeline events). **Paginate** until all comments are retrieved. This is essential when re-triaging a `⏳ waiting-for-info` issue: the author often supplies the missing details in a follow-up comment rather than editing the body, so the completeness check in Step 2 must consider comments — not just the original body — to avoid asking for the same information again.

### Step 1b: Check for Duplicates and Existing Solutions

Search for related issues and PRs to avoid duplicate work:

1. **Search open issues**: Use `mcp_github_search_issues` with keywords from the issue title/body, scoped to `repo:db-ux-design-system/core-web state:open`. Look for issues addressing the same problem or feature.
2. **Search closed issues**: Same search with `state:closed` — check if this was already resolved or intentionally rejected.
3. **Search open PRs**: Use `mcp_github_search_pull_requests` with relevant keywords scoped to `repo:db-ux-design-system/core-web state:open`. Check if someone is already working on a fix.
4. **Search merged PRs**: Same search with `state:closed is:merged` — the fix may already be merged but the issue wasn't linked/closed.

**Always exclude the issue currently under review** from the candidate set before evaluating or reporting duplicates. Keyword searches derived from the issue's own title/body will return that same issue — for narrow searches it may be the only result — so filter out its number first to avoid reporting the issue as its own duplicate.

**If duplicates or solutions are found**, include them in the summary comment (Step 7):

```markdown
### 🔗 Related Issues & PRs

- **Possible duplicate**: #<number> — <title> (open/closed)
- **Related PR**: #<number> — <title> (open/merged)
- **Previously discussed in**: #<number>
```

If the issue is clearly a duplicate of an existing open issue, mention this prominently but **do not close the issue** — leave that decision to a human maintainer.

### Step 2: Validate Template Completeness

Determine which template was used based on the issue type and labels:

- **Bug Report**: Check that the body contains a "Reproduction case" section and "Expected Behaviour" section (both are required). Note any missing optional fields.
- **Copilot Instructions feedback**: Check that the required textarea is filled in. Match the exact form label `❗ What didn’t work as expected?` (note the ❗ emoji and the curly apostrophe `’`), or — more robustly — match by its field id `issue-description` rather than by heading text, to avoid marking valid feedback as incomplete.
- **No template used**: Flag this — the issue may lack structured information.

When deciding whether a required field is still missing, evaluate the issue body **together with the comments/timeline** fetched in Step 1 — an author may have provided the missing details in a follow-up comment rather than editing the original body.

Rate completeness:

- ✅ **Complete** — All required fields filled with meaningful content
- ⚠️ **Partial** — Required fields present but sparse or unclear
- ❌ **Incomplete** — Missing required fields or entirely unstructured

### Step 3: Community Feedback Label

Check if the issue author is a CODEOWNER (team member):

**Team members**: `mfranzke`, `nmerget`, `michaelmkraus`, `bruno-sch`

- If the author is **NOT** in the list above → add the label `👩‍👧‍👦communityFeedback`
- If the author **IS** a team member → do not add the community label

### Step 4: Determine Priority and Effort

Based on the issue content, estimate:

**Priority** (single-select: `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`):

- **Urgent** — Production-breaking, security vulnerability, blocks many users
- **High** — Significant bug affecting core functionality, many users impacted
- **Medium** — Non-critical bug, feature request with clear value, moderate impact
- **Low** — Nice-to-have improvement, cosmetic issue, edge case

**Effort** (single-select: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`):

- **High** — Requires architectural changes, multiple packages, extensive testing, or major refactoring
- **Medium** — Moderate code changes across a few files, some testing required
- **Low** — Small fix, documentation update, single-file change, straightforward implementation

Set these using `mcp_github_issue_write` with `issue_fields`. **This depends on a feature flag:** GitHub MCP only exposes `list_issue_fields` and the `issue_fields` write parameter when the `remote_mcp_issue_fields` feature flag is enabled (see the [GitHub MCP feature flags docs](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/feature-flags.md)). Treat this step as **conditional**, not mandatory:

1. First attempt `mcp_github_list_issue_fields` (owner/repo) to confirm the exact `Priority` and `Effort` field names and their valid option names for this repository.
2. **If the field tools are unavailable** (the flag is not enabled, or the call errors with an unknown-tool/feature-disabled error): skip setting Priority/Effort, record the estimated values in the summary comment (Step 7) instead, and **continue** with labels and the rest of the workflow. Do not abort triage.
3. **If available**: set the fields — `field_option_name` is validated against the field's options before the API call:

```json
{
	"issue_fields": [
		{ "field_name": "Priority", "field_option_name": "<chosen value>" },
		{ "field_name": "Effort", "field_option_name": "<chosen value>" }
	]
}
```

### Step 4b: Set Issue Type (if not already set)

If the issue does **not** have a type assigned (the `type` field returned by `mcp_github_issue_read` (method: `get`) is null or empty), consider assigning one — but only when there is enough information to do so reliably:

- **If completeness is ❌ Incomplete** (from Step 2): **do not assign a type yet.** Leave it unset so a sparse, possibly-misleading report doesn't get locked into a wrong guess. Request the missing information first (Step 6/7); the type can be assigned on a later triage run once the report is at least ⚠️ Partial.
- **If completeness is ⚠️ Partial or ✅ Complete**: determine and assign the type as below.

First call `mcp_github_list_issue_types` (owner: `db-ux-design-system`) to get the valid type values configured for the organization, then choose from them:

| Type    | When to assign                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Bug`   | The issue describes broken behavior, a regression, or something not working as expected                                |
| `Task`  | A well-scoped piece of work: tooling improvement, refactor, chore, or low-effort feature (Effort = Low)                |
| `Story` | A broader feature request or improvement that requires discussion, design, or multiple tasks (Effort = Medium or High) |

**Heuristic**: If the estimated Effort is **Medium or High**, this is a strong indicator the issue should be a **Story** (unless it's clearly a bug). Low-effort improvements and chores are typically **Tasks**.

Set the type using `mcp_github_issue_write` (method: `update`) with the `type` parameter.

**Re-evaluate AI-assigned types after new information arrives.** Because future triage runs only reconsider the type when it is null, a type guessed from an initially sparse report would otherwise never be corrected. When re-triaging an issue (e.g. after the author clarifies in a comment), if the existing type was assigned by AI triage and the new information contradicts it, update the type to match — do not skip the type step just because a value is already present.

### Step 5: Match Existing Labels

Review the issue content and determine if any of these existing labels apply. Only add labels that are clearly relevant — do not over-label.

> **Verify before applying.** Label names must match the repository's actual labels exactly. Before adding any label, confirm it exists with `mcp_github_get_label` — assigning a non-existent label fails the whole update. The names in the tables below reflect the repository's current labels (for example, the bug label is `🐛bug`; a plain `bug` label does not exist). Skip any label that no longer exists rather than failing the update.

#### Bug / Issue Type Labels

Add matching labels alongside the status label decided in Step 6 (`🤖ai-triaged` or `⏳waiting-for-info`).

### Step 6: Add Triage Status Label

**First decide the completeness branch (from Step 2) before applying any status label** — this determines _which_ label to add and must be settled here, not deferred to Step 8:

- **❌ Incomplete** → do **NOT** add `🤖ai-triaged`. Add `⏳waiting-for-info` instead (see Step 8), so the issue is re-triaged in future batch runs once the author responds.
- **⚠️ Partial or ✅ Complete** → add `🤖ai-triaged` to mark that this issue has been fully processed by the AI triage bot.

**Label creation**: Before assigning any label, verify it exists using `mcp_github_get_label`. The GitHub REST API does **not** auto-create labels on assignment — applying a non-existent label fails the entire update with a validation error and the issue is never marked, so the batch run keeps re-selecting it.
If `🤖ai-triaged` (or `⏳waiting-for-info`) does not exist, create it before assigning:

- **Preferred (MCP)**: use `mcp_github_label_write` (method: `create`), which lives in the same GitHub MCP Labels toolset as `get_label`. Example: name `🤖ai-triaged`, color `7057ff`, description `Issue triaged by AI bot`.
- **Fallback (no write tool available)**: if the labels toolset is read-only in this session (only `get_label` is exposed, no `label_write`), create it out-of-band — ask a maintainer, or run `gh label create "🤖ai-triaged" --color 7057ff --description "Issue triaged by AI bot"`.

Never attempt to assign a label that does not yet exist.

**Preserving existing labels**: To avoid accidentally removing labels added by other users or automations, always **re-read the current labels** immediately before updating (using `mcp_github_issue_read` method `get_labels`). Then merge the new labels into the current set. Use `mcp_github_issue_write` (method: `update`) with the **complete merged label list** (all existing labels + new labels to add).

**Clear `⏳waiting-for-info` on successful re-triage**: when a previously incomplete issue is now rated ✅ Complete or ⚠️ Partial (the author supplied the requested info), **remove** any existing `⏳waiting-for-info` label as you add `🤖ai-triaged` — do not just merge. Otherwise the issue would stay flagged as waiting on the author even though it is no longer missing information. Build the merged set as: existing labels − `⏳waiting-for-info` + `🤖ai-triaged` (+ any matching content labels), then write that complete set.

### Step 7: Post Summary Comment

Post a comment on the issue using `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` with this structure:

```markdown
🤖 **AI Triage Summary**

> ⚠️ This is an automated analysis generated by a bot. It may contain inaccuracies. A human maintainer will review this issue.

### Template Completeness

<completeness assessment — ✅/⚠️/❌ with details on what's present and what's missing>

### 🔗 Related Issues & PRs

<list any duplicate issues, related open/closed issues, or PRs that address the same topic. If nothing found, state "No related issues or PRs found.">

### Suggested Solution

<brief analysis of what a solution could look like, referencing relevant packages/files if possible>

### Temporary Workaround

<if applicable, describe a workaround users can apply until this is resolved. If no workaround is apparent, state "No obvious workaround identified.">

### Triage Details

| Field              | Value    |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Priority           | <value>  |
| Effort             | <value>  |
| Labels added       | <list>   |
| Community feedback | <yes/no> |

```

### Step 8: Handle Missing Information

If the issue is rated ❌ **Incomplete**, also ask the author for clarification in the comment:

```markdown
### ❓ Missing Information

To help us resolve this faster, please provide:

- <list specific missing required fields>
```

**Important**: This reaffirms the branch already decided in Step 6 — for incomplete issues, do **NOT** add the `🤖ai-triaged` label. Add the exact `⏳waiting-for-info` label instead (not an "equivalent" — the batch filter below matches this exact string), so the issue will be re-triaged in subsequent batch runs once the author provides the missing information. `🤖ai-triaged` is only applied when the issue is rated ✅ Complete or ⚠️ Partial.

If `⏳waiting-for-info` does not yet exist in the repository, create it first using the same create-if-missing procedure as in Step 6 (`mcp_github_label_write` method `create`, or the `gh label create` fallback), e.g. name `⏳waiting-for-info`, color `fbca04`, description `Waiting for the author to provide missing information`. Never assign it before it exists.

---

## Batch Issue Triage

When the user asks to triage all new/unprocessed issues (e.g. "check all new issues", "triage open issues"), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Fetch Untriaged Issues

Search for open issues that do NOT have the `🤖ai-triaged` label:

```markdown
Use mcp_github_list_issues with:

- owner: db-ux-design-system
- repo: core-web
- state: OPEN
- perPage: 100
```

**Paginate**: Follow `pageInfo.endCursor` with `after` parameter until `hasNextPage` is false. Collect all pages before filtering.

Then filter out:

- Issues that already have the `🤖ai-triaged` label.
- Issues that carry the `⏳waiting-for-info` label **and** have not been updated since they were last triaged. Compare the issue's `updatedAt` with the timestamp of the bot's last triage comment (or the time the label was applied): only re-triage a waiting issue once its `updatedAt` is newer — i.e. the author has actually added the missing information. This prevents reprocessing unchanged incomplete issues and posting a duplicate missing-information comment on every batch run.

### Step 2: Generate Spec with Tasks

Create a spec file at `.kiro/specs/issue-triage-batch/tasks.md` listing each untriaged issue as a task:

```markdown
# Issue Triage Batch

Triage all open issues that haven't been processed by the AI bot yet.

## Tasks

- [ ] Triage issue #<number>: <title>
- [ ] Triage issue #<number>: <title>
- [ ] Triage issue #<number>: <title>
      ...
```

### Step 3: Execute Tasks

Process each task sequentially using the **Single Issue Triage Workflow** (Steps 1–8 above).

After completing each issue, mark the task as done in the spec file:

```markdown
- [x] Triage issue #<number>: <title>
```

### Step 4: Cleanup

After all tasks are processed, delete the `.kiro/specs/issue-triage-batch/` directory to avoid accumulating stale spec files.

---

## Notes

- **Never close issues** — Only triage and annotate. Humans decide on resolution.
- **Be conservative with Priority** — When unsure, lean toward Medium.
- **Effort is about implementation complexity** — Not urgency. A simple but urgent fix is Low effort + High priority.
- **Respect existing labels** — Do not remove labels that were already on the issue. Only add new ones.
- **Multiple issues in one run** — Use the batch workflow to avoid rate limiting and keep progress tracked.
