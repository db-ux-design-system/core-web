### Which package should I choose?

**For JavaScript framework-specific components**: Choose your framework package (React, Angular, Vue, Web Components) which includes styling and JavaScript behavior.

**For other users**: Use `@db-ux/core-components` - it includes everything you need (foundations + component styles).

**For design tokens only**: Use `@db-ux/core-foundations` if you only need colors, spacing, fonts, and icons without pre-built component styles.

## How to use

1. **Install your preferred package** via npm or yarn:
   - For React: `npm i @db-ux/react-core-components`
   - For Angular: `npm i @db-ux/ngx-core-components`
   - For Vue: `npm i @db-ux/v-core-components`
   - For Web Components: `npm i @db-ux/wc-core-components`
   - For styling only: `npm i @db-ux/core-components`

2. **Include the CSS styles** as described in the "Styling Dependencies" section of each package's `README`.

> **ðŸ’¡ Note**: All framework packages automatically include the necessary foundation styles - you don't need to install `@db-ux/core-foundations` separately!

We even provide some [examples of integrations](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/examples).

## Creating Custom Components

For developers looking to create custom components that extend the design system in their applications, we provide comprehensive guidance:

ðŸ“– **[Creating Custom Components Guide](docs/creating-custom-components.md)** - Learn how to build your own components using design system foundations

This guide covers:
- **Setup and Configuration**: Getting started with the design system packages
- **Design Principles**: Following DB UX Design System guidelines and best practices  
- **Component Patterns**: Structured approaches to building consistent components
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations for cards, forms, navigation, and more
- **Framework Support**: Specific guidance for React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla HTML/CSS
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring your components are inclusive and compliant
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid and how to maintain design system consistency

### DB Theme

In case that you're building a website or application for Deutsche Bahn, you'll additionally have to install the DB Theme via the [`@db-ux/db-theme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/db-theme) node package (even also available as an inner source node package, as described within that packages [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ux/db-theme)).

## Components

We maintain a [status overview](https://github.com/orgs/db-ux-design-system/projects/4/views/1) for all components.

## Core principles

<details>
  <summary><strong>
	Consistent & Compliant
	</strong></summary>

DB UX Design System Core Web is part of [DB UX Design System](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/UI-Komponenten),
that are the guidelines for any Personenverkehr Customer and Deutsche Bahn Enterprise website and web applications.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Accessible</strong></summary>

DB UX Design System leverages semantic HTML, ARIA roles, states and properties to apply our styles wherever possible, thus
enforcing correct, accessible markup. And we're quality checking this in partnership with
the [Team Digital Accessibility](https://db.de/8pei5n).

</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Declarative</strong></summary>

DB UX Design System uses declarative selectors instead of visual helpers to ensure our HTML class names and structure are human
read- and understandable, lean, performant and so much easier to update.

</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Evergreen</strong></summary>

As [DB UX Design System](https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/UI-Komponenten) evolves, so does DB UX Design System version 3, meaning apps only need to keep their DB UX Design System Core Web package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.

</details>

## Migration

### From DB UI Core or DB UI Elements to DB UX Design System Core

We're providing a detailed migration for each component next to the documentation of each component, like e.g.

## FAQ

### Unexpected "new" colors

> We've updated to the stable version of DB UX Design System (v3) version >= 1.x, and now the colors that were supposed to be red, are colored in blue (`514ec7`).

Please have a look at the [migration guide from version 0.6.x to version 0.7.x](https://github.com/db-ux-design-system/core-web/blob/main/docs/migration/v0.6.x-to-v0.7.x.md#removed-brand-assets), you need to install and reference the DB Theme, if you're building a website or web application for Deutsche Bahn.

## Things to keep in mind

### Developed for and driven by the community

is mainly driven by the community and adapted out of the work done in projects and through the huge amount of feedback
that we're gaining out of the community. So please support us in any way possible, this is greatly appreciated!
