# Migration (3.x.x) âž¡ 4.0.0

## Custom Select: renamed `ariaListLabel` property to `listLabel`

Due to Angular 20's handling of properties starting with the phrase "aria," we needed to rename the `ariaListLabel` property to `listLabel`.

## Switch: remove `emphasis` property

The `emphasis` property has been removed from switch component. In a way this has been replaced by our introduction of Validation to this component.

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/core-migration --type=v300_v400 --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our properties for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to properties.
