## Migration Beta (1.x.x) âž¡ 2.0.0

## icon-before/-after

We renamed the `data-icon-after` and `data-icon-before` properties to `data-icon-trailing` and `data-icon-leading`,
as well the properties in components to `iconTrailing` and/or `iconLeading`.
Furthermore, we added a trailing icon to the `db-button`/`DBButton` component.

You can still use `db-icon`/`icon` in most elements/components, which results in showing the default icon.
Most of the time this will be the leading icon, but in some cases it might be the trailing icon, depending on the component.

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/core-migration --type=v200_v300 --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our properties for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to properties.
