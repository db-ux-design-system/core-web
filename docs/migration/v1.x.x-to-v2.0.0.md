## Migration Beta (1.x.x) ➡ 2.0.0

## Angular

> **Note:** We upgrade the components to use [`signals`](https://angular.dev/guide/signals). This requires the latest version of Angular (18.0.0 or higher). If you are using an older version, please upgrade to the latest versions (18 or 19) of Angular.

### Align angular events

We removed `on` for every event in Angular to match the best practices of Angular. The following events have been changed:

- `onClick` ➔ `click`
- `onChange` ➔ `change`
- `onFocus` ➔ `focus`
- `onBlur` ➔ `blur`
- `onInput` ➔ `input`
- `onRemove` ➔ `remove`
- `onSelect` ➔ `select`
- `onToggle` ➔ `toggle`
- `onClose` ➔ `close`
- `onTabSelect` ➔ `tabSelect`
- `onIndexChange` ➔ `indexChange`

## Global

- Renamed all `border-height` props to `border-width`

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/core-migration --type=v100_v200 --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our properties for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to properties.
