## Migration Beta (1.x.x) âž¡ 2.0.0

## Foundation

### Web Fonts

We've replaced DB Screen fonts by their successor, DB Neo Screen. If you've copied over those fonts out of the DB theme package to your project manually, you would need to do this again for these new files.

### Design Tokens

- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-origin-hovered`
- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-origin-pressed`
- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-bg-basic-emphasis-60-hovered`
- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-bg-basic-emphasis-60-pressed`
- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-bg-basic-emphasis-50-hovered`
- Removed `--db-adaptive-on-bg-basic-emphasis-50-pressed`

## Global

- Renamed all `border-height` props to `border-width`

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ux/core-migration --type=v100_v200 --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our properties for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to properties.
