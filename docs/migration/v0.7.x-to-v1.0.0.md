## Migration Beta (0.7.x) âž¡ Beta (1.0.0)

### Components

#### Badge

We updated the colors for the `weak` badge to match better with `strong` and the new `origin` badge.

#### Tag

We updated the colors for the `weak` tag to match better with `strong` and the new `origin` tag.

## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a CLI tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ui/migration --type=v007_vXXX --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our icon names for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to icons.
