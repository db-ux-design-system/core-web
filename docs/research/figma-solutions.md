# Figma Solutions Research

This document evaluates Figma's developer tools and solutions for design system integration, specifically focusing on Code Connect and the VS Code extension.

## Figma Code Connect

**URL:** [https://github.com/figma/code-connect](https://github.com/figma/code-connect)
**Status:** Active development by Figma

### Overview

Figma Code Connect is a tool that bridges the gap between design and development by connecting Figma components to their code implementations. It allows developers to publish and link component code directly to Figma design components.

### Key Features

1. **Component Linking**: Connect React, Vue, Angular, and other framework components to Figma designs
2. **Code Examples**: Display actual implementation code within Figma
3. **Props Mapping**: Map Figma component properties to code props
4. **Multi-framework Support**: Supports multiple frontend frameworks
5. **CLI Integration**: Command-line tool for publishing and managing connections
6. **Team Collaboration**: Enables designers and developers to stay in sync

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Installation
npm install --save-dev @figma/code-connect

# Publishing components
npx figma connect publish

# Configuration in component files
import figma from '@figma/code-connect'
import { Button } from './Button'

figma.connect(Button, "figma://component-url", {
  props: {
    variant: figma.enum("Variant", {
      Primary: "primary",
      Secondary: "secondary"
    }),
    disabled: figma.boolean("Disabled"),
    children: figma.string("Label")
  },
  example: (props) => <Button {...props} />
})
```

### Benefits for DB UX Design System

1. **Design-Code Sync**: Keep Figma designs and code implementations synchronized
2. **Developer Experience**: Reduce time spent translating designs to code
3. **Component Documentation**: Automatically document component usage within Figma
4. **Multi-framework Support**: Align with our Angular, React, Vue, and Web Components outputs
5. **Team Collaboration**: Bridge communication gap between design and development teams

### Integration Challenges

1. **Setup Complexity**: Requires configuration for each component and framework
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Need to keep Code Connect configurations updated
3. **Figma Organization Access**: Requires appropriate Figma organization permissions
4. **Multi-framework Complexity**: Managing connections for 4+ frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, Stencil)

### Compatibility with DB UX Design System

- ✅ **Multi-framework Support**: Aligns with our Angular, React, Vue, and Web Components
- ✅ **Component-based**: Perfect fit for our component library structure
- ✅ **TypeScript Support**: Compatible with our TypeScript-first approach
- ✅ **Build Integration**: Can be integrated into our npm scripts and CI/CD
- ⚠️ **Mitosis Integration**: May require additional configuration due to our Mitosis-based component generation

## Figma VS Code Extension

**URL:** [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension)
**Status:** Active, maintained by Figma

### Overview

The official Figma VS Code extension provides direct integration between VS Code and Figma, allowing developers to access designs, prototypes, and collaborate without leaving their IDE.

### Key Features

1. **Design Preview**: View Figma designs directly in VS Code
2. **Design Tokens**: Extract design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) from Figma
3. **Asset Export**: Export images and icons directly from Figma
4. **Live Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration on designs
5. **Design System Integration**: Connect with design system files
6. **Code Generation**: Generate code snippets from Figma components

### Technical Implementation

```json
// VS Code settings.json
{
  "figma.accessToken": "your-figma-token",
  "figma.teamId": "your-team-id",
  "figma.fileUrl": "figma-file-url"
}
```

### Benefits for DB UX Design System

1. **IDE Integration**: Seamless workflow within VS Code
2. **Design Token Extraction**: Automated extraction of design tokens
3. **Asset Management**: Direct access to design assets without switching contexts
4. **Real-time Updates**: Stay updated with design changes
5. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce context switching between tools

### Integration Challenges

1. **Token Format**: May require custom mapping to our existing token structure
2. **Workflow Changes**: Requires team adoption and workflow adjustments
3. **Permission Management**: Needs proper Figma access management
4. **Asset Organization**: Integration with existing asset management workflows

### Compatibility with DB UX Design System

- ✅ **VS Code Focus**: Aligns with our documented VS Code support
- ✅ **Design Token Integration**: Could enhance our existing token system
- ✅ **Asset Workflow**: Could streamline icon and asset management
- ⚠️ **Team Adoption**: Requires training and workflow changes

## Comparison with Current Workflow

### Current State

Our current design system workflow involves:
- Manual translation from Figma designs to code
- Separate maintenance of design tokens and code tokens
- Manual asset extraction and optimization
- Documentation scattered across multiple tools

### Potential Improvements

1. **Automated Sync**: Reduce manual work in keeping designs and code aligned
2. **Token Automation**: Automated design token extraction and updates
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Code examples directly in Figma
4. **Improved DX**: Better developer experience with IDE integration

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Evaluation and Setup

1. **Pilot Project**: Start with a few key components (Button, Input, Card)
2. **Team Training**: Train design and development teams on new tools
3. **Workflow Documentation**: Document new processes and best practices

### Phase 2: Integration

1. **Code Connect Setup**: Implement for React components first, then expand
2. **VS Code Extension**: Pilot with development team
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate Code Connect publishing in build pipeline

### Phase 3: Optimization

1. **Multi-framework Support**: Extend Code Connect to all frameworks
2. **Token Automation**: Implement automated token sync
3. **Team Adoption**: Full team rollout with refined workflows

### Technical Implementation Plan

```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "figma:connect:publish": "figma connect publish",
    "figma:connect:build": "figma connect build",
    "figma:tokens:sync": "figma-tokens --output src/tokens"
  }
}
```

### Required Configuration Files

1. **figma.config.json**: Code Connect configuration
2. **VS Code workspace settings**: Extension configuration
3. **CI/CD pipeline updates**: Automated publishing

## Conclusion

Both Figma solutions offer significant value for improving design-development collaboration and workflow efficiency. Code Connect particularly aligns well with our component-based architecture and multi-framework approach, while the VS Code extension could enhance daily developer productivity.

**Recommendation**: Implement both solutions in phases, starting with Code Connect for key components and gradually expanding coverage while training the team on new workflows.

### Next Steps

1. Set up Figma organization permissions
2. Install and configure Code Connect for pilot components
3. Install VS Code extension for development team evaluation
4. Create documentation and training materials
5. Develop integration scripts for our build pipeline
