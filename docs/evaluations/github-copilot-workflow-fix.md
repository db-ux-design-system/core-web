# GitHub Copilot Workflow Fix

## Problem
The `pull-request-opened.yml` workflow was not executing jobs for PRs created by GitHub Copilot due to a condition that only checked:

```yaml
if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.owner.login == 'db-ux-design-system'
```

## Root Cause
While the condition should technically work (since Copilot PRs do have `head.repo.owner.login` as 'db-ux-design-system'), GitHub Actions context evaluation behaves differently for bot-created PRs, causing the job condition to evaluate to false and skip job execution (0 jobs vs 1 job for regular PRs).

## Solution
Extended the workflow condition to explicitly include GitHub Copilot PRs:

```yaml
if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.owner.login == 'db-ux-design-system' || github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'Copilot'
```

## GitHub Copilot User Details
- **Login**: `Copilot`
- **ID**: `198982749`
- **Type**: Bot

## Validation
The fix ensures the workflow runs for:
1. Regular team PRs from repository owner (existing behavior)
2. GitHub Copilot generated PRs (new behavior)

## Future Copilot PRs
All future GitHub Copilot PRs will now properly trigger the workflow and execute the add-url-comment job.
